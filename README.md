# This is ollama-analyzer-panel grafana:
## Analyze metrics with AI... without relying on the cloud! 

A visualization plugin that connects to a language model (LLM) to automatically interpret your dashboard data.

## Getting started

You can see how to install the plugin in my blog post: https://blog.xavigonzalez.net/analiza-tus-metricas-con-ia-desde-grafana/

The plugin is still in development and has not been signed.
It also doesn't have tests.
It's based on the idea of ​​the <a href="https://github.com/tomglenn/tomglenn-openanalyser-panel">tomglenn</a> plugin, but uses dashboard data to perform the analysis and integrates ollama.
